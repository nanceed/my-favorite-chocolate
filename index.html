        <h2>Why Dandelion Chocolate?</h2>
        <h3>Two Ingredients. That's It.</h3>
        <p>
        Since our earliest days, we've focused on bringing out the nuances within really good cocoa, using only two ingredients:
        ethically sourced, well-fermented, carefully roasted beans and organic cane sugar.
        
        To allow the most flavors to shine through, we don't add cocoa butter, soy lecithin, vanilla, flavorings, or
        preservatives—all commonly used in chocolate making.
        </p>
        <p>
        We have found that good relationships are absolutely essential to procuring consistently good flavor. That’s why, year
        after year, we strive to strengthen our relationships with cocoa producers by traveling to each origin. We work closely
        with the producers who grow, ferment, and dry the single-origin cocoa beans we source, so we can be confident we’re
        sharing some of the best and most distinctive cocoa with you.

            <p>
              After five years of planning and renovations, we opened our 16th Street Chocolate Factory in 2019. The century-old brick
              building, converted from a former print shop, covers almost a city block near the north edge of San Francisco’s Mission
              District. Inside, visitors inhale the heady scent of molten chocolate, hear cocoa beans rattle and roast, watch
              chocolate makers in action, sift handfuls of dried beans, and sample every form of cocoa product — from tangy fresh
              cacao fruit to smooth finished chocolate. Our 16th Street Factory is the new heart of Dandelion chocolate making, where
              single-origin cocoa beans become two-ingredient chocolate.

            We opened our first factory and café on Valencia Street in 2012 to share the bean-to-bar chocolate-making experience
            with visitors. We bought, built, and repurposed machinery to perform every step of the process, and constructed an open
            space where guests may enjoy a front-row seat. To this day, we invite Valencia Street visitors to come in and stay a
            while — sample our single-origin chocolate bars, savor a steaming mug of House Hot Chocolate, and watch our chocolate
            makers at work.
            <br>
            With working factory equipment on view, our café at Valencia makes a terrific setting for casual celebrations. Guests
            are served fresh pastries and café beverages; additional refreshments may also be requested.

            San Francisco’s historic Ferry Building is an architectural landmark that has housed a gourmet food hall since 2003. In
            2014, we joined the Ferry Building's artisan makers, opening a Marketplace shop to showcase local collaborators’
            creations and offer our own bean-to-bar chocolate. Stop by for gifts, chocolate bars, hot chocolate drinks, and freshly
            toasted s’mores.
            <br>
            Our Kitchen team bakes fresh cookies and pastries from our single-origin chocolate each day. We also offer made-to-order
            hot chocolates, Ritual coffee drinks, frozen hot chocolate, horchata, and more.

            <p>
              We've always wanted a location on Fillmore Street. In 2022, we were able to sign a short-term lease for a holiday retail
              pop-up at 2115 Fillmore Street. Sanga Architects’ Monica, who has played a leading role in designing many of our
              previous shops, returned with Anh to design and build this space for our guests. Fillmore will soon undergo renovations
              to become a permanent location. Late this summer, we will close for a few months, and expect to be up and running by the
              holiday season.
              <br>
              Stop by our holiday pop-up on Fillmore and sample single-origin chocolate or find a special gift from our retail
              display.
